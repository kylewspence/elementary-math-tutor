# Subtraction Feature Documentation

## Overview
The subtraction feature has been successfully implemented for the Math Tutor application, providing interactive subtraction practice with borrowing support. This implementation follows the exact patterns established by the addition feature to ensure architectural consistency and zero drift from existing operations.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Core Features Completed
- **Interactive Subtraction Problems**: Multi-digit subtraction with borrowing support
- **10-Level Progression System**: From single-digit to complex multi-digit problems
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Sticky controls and responsive design
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with Enter key advancement
- **Session Persistence**: Auto-save and restore functionality
- **API Integration**: Server and local problem generation
- **Visual Feedback**: Error highlighting and success notifications

### 🏗️ Architecture Approach
- **Zero Shared Components**: All subtraction components copied from addition patterns
- **Exact Pattern Replication**: Preserved mobile sticky controls, button logic, and UI patterns
- **No Regression**: Division, Addition, and Multiplication operations remain unchanged
- **Centralized Types**: GameMode type centralized in `src/types/game.ts`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Problem Generation
- **Levels 1-10**: Progressive difficulty from single-digit to complex multi-digit
- **Borrowing Logic**: Automatic detection and handling of borrowing scenarios
- **Validation**: Ensures minuend ≥ subtrahend for valid problems
- **API Integration**: Both server and local generation support

### Interactive Features
- **Borrow Fields**: Interactive input for borrowing values
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on answer correctness
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded correct/incorrect answers
- **Mobile Controls**: Touch-friendly interface with sticky action buttons

### User Interface
- **Consistent Design**: Identical to addition layout and styling
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/error states and progress indicators

## Integration Points

### App.tsx Integration
- **Game State Hook**: `useSubtractionGameState()` with full state management
- **Keyboard Navigation**: `useSubtractionKeyboardNav()` for input handling
- **Session Persistence**: Auto-save/restore for subtraction state
- **Problem Generation**: Automatic problem creation on level changes
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus setting for optimal UX

### Header.tsx Integration
- **Tab Button**: Subtraction tab following exact addition pattern
- **Active States**: Proper highlighting and selection states
- **GameMode Support**: Full integration with centralized type system

## Testing Coverage

### ✅ Completed Testing
- **Visual Consistency**: All UI elements match addition patterns
- **Behavioral Testing**: Identical interaction patterns across operations
- **Integration Testing**: Mode switching and problem generation
- **Mobile Testing**: Touch controls and responsive layouts
- **Regression Testing**: All existing operations verified unchanged

### 🔧 Bug Fixes Applied
- **Enter Key Navigation**: Fixed keyboard advancement for "next problem"
- **Field Validation**: Corrected borrow field logic for proper completion detection
- **NaN Protection**: Added safeguards against undefined digit display

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

### Borrowing Visualization
- **Educational Focus**: Visual representation of borrowing process
- **Optional Feature**: Non-breaking enhancement that can be toggled
- **Animation Support**: Smooth transitions showing borrowing flow
- **Consistency**: Following same patterns as subtraction implementation

### Addition Carry Logic
- **Parallel Feature**: Interactive carry fields for addition
- **Pattern Consistency**: Mirror subtraction's borrowing field approach
- **Educational Value**: Enhanced understanding of place value concepts

## Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded only when subtraction mode is active
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized re-renders and state updates
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection
- **API Caching**: Efficient problem fetching and caching strategies

## Deployment Notes
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Safe to deploy without affecting existing features
