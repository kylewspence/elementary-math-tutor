# Long Division Tutor - Development Log

## Project Status: Phase 1 - Foundation

### Current Sprint Goals
- [ ] Set up complete file structure
- [ ] Create TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Implement basic component structure
- [ ] Test Tailwind CSS integration

---

## Development Sessions

### Session 1 - Project Setup (Date: Current)

#### Completed
- âœ… Created PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md with comprehensive requirements
- âœ… Set up development log tracking system
- âœ… Analyzed existing project structure (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

#### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Creating complete file structure based on specification
- ðŸ”„ Setting up component architecture

#### Next Steps
1. Create all directory structure and placeholder files
2. Define TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Set up basic component structure
4. Implement division calculation algorithms

#### Technical Decisions Made
- **Framework**: Continuing with existing Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (already configured)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- **File Structure**: Feature-based organization with shared components

#### Notes
- Project already has Tailwind CSS v4 properly configured
- Using modern @import "tailwindcss" approach
- Good foundation for building upon

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Organization
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DivisionProblem/     # Core division functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UI/                  # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout/              # Layout components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/                   # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                   # Pure utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ types/                   # TypeScript definitions
â””â”€â”€ assets/                  # Static assets
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Keyboard-First**: All interactions optimized for numpad use
2. **Step-by-Step**: Sequential validation and progression
3. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions
4. **Educational Focus**: Clear mathematical representation
