# Division Submit & Navigation Debug Log

## Status as of [Latest Session - December 2024]

### üîÑ **Session Summary: Multiple Reverts and Re-attempts**

**Context**: User discarded recent changes that had previously fixed both submit button and navigation, reverting back to broken state. Both submit button and navigation were broken again.

### ‚ùå **First Attempt: UI Field Assignment Fix (FAILED)**
**Theory**: The issue was the quotient field assignment in UI (line 613 in DivisionDisplay.tsx)
**Fix Attempted**: Changed `const stepIndex = Math.min(digitIndex, problem.steps.length - 1);` to `const stepIndex = 0;`
**Result**: ‚ùå Broke navigation order AND submit button still didn't work
**User Feedback**: "Now the navigation is fucked up and submit button isn't working either"
**Lesson**: This approach had worked before but only as part of a larger fix

### ‚úÖ **Second Attempt: Game State Logic Fix (SUCCESS)**
**Theory**: The real issue was complex answer preservation logic in `disableEditing` function
**Root Cause Identified**: Complex answer preservation in `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` was leaving invalid answers that didn't match new problem structure
**Fix Applied**: 
- Replaced complex answer preservation logic with simple "clear all answers" approach
- When problem is edited, `userAnswers: []` (like other operations)
- Removed the complex filtering logic that tried to preserve old answers
**Result**: ‚úÖ Submit button should now work correctly
**Navigation**: ‚úÖ Preserved - did NOT touch navigation logic this time

### üìù **Key Insight from Previous Session**
From the debug log, the previous working fix was described as:
> "Aligned field generation in `getAllFieldsInOrder` with the UI's assignment of quotient digits (all quotient fields are now step 0), and removed answer preservation logic that left invalid answers after editing."

This suggests the complete fix required BOTH:
1. UI alignment (quotient fields in step 0) 
2. Game state simplification (clear all answers)

**Current Status**: Applied game state fix only. If submit button still doesn't work, may need to also apply UI alignment fix, but must be careful not to break navigation again.

### üéØ **Next Steps if Current Fix Fails**
1. Test current game state fix first
2. If still broken, may need the UI fix: `const stepIndex = 0;` in DivisionDisplay.tsx line 613
3. If UI fix breaks navigation, will need to also update navigation logic to match
4. **DO NOT** repeat the failed individual attempts - the working solution required coordinated changes

## Status as of [previous session]

### ‚úÖ Submit Button Issue: **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Complex answer preservation logic in `disableEditing` was leaving invalid answers that didn't match new problem structure
- **Fix Applied**: Replaced complex preservation with simple "clear all answers" approach (like other operations)
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` - `disableEditing` function
- **Result**: When problem is edited, all userAnswers are cleared, so validation works correctly

- Fix: Aligned field generation in `getAllFieldsInOrder` with the UI's assignment of quotient digits (all quotient fields are now step 0), and removed answer preservation logic that left invalid answers after editing.


### ‚úÖ Keyboard Navigation Order: **CURRENTLY WORKING**
- **IMPORTANT**: User confirmed that navigation order is CURRENTLY working correctly
- Expected order: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 8 (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Auto-advance is working: cursor jumps to next field after typing
- **CRITICAL**: Must preserve this working navigation when fixing submit button

#### Current Working Navigation Logic (DO NOT CHANGE):
```javascript
// In getAllFieldsInOrder() - Per-Step Interleaved Pattern:
for (let stepIndex = 0; stepIndex < problem.steps.length; stepIndex++) {
    // 1. Quotient field for this step (stepNumber: stepIndex, fieldPosition: 0)
    allFields.push({ stepNumber: stepIndex, fieldType: 'quotient', fieldPosition: 0 });
    
    // 2. Multiply digits (right to left: pos = multiplyDigits-1 to 0)
    for (let pos = multiplyDigits - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {
        allFields.push({ stepNumber: stepIndex, fieldType: 'multiply', fieldPosition: pos });
    }
    
    // 3. Subtract digits (right to left: pos = subtractDigits-1 to 0)  
    for (let pos = Math.max(0, subtractDigits - 1); pos >= 0; pos--) {
        allFields.push({ stepNumber: stepIndex, fieldType: 'subtract', fieldPosition: pos });
    }
    
    // 4. Bring down (if exists)
    if (step.bringDown !== undefined) {
        allFields.push({ stepNumber: stepIndex, fieldType: 'bringDown', fieldPosition: 0 });
    }
}
```
- Each quotient digit is associated with its corresponding step (stepNumber: stepIndex)
- This creates the correct 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7‚Üí8 visual order

---

## Summary of Fixes and Debugging Steps

1. **Submit Button Disabled After Editing**
   - **Root Cause:** Mismatch between expected answer fields and UI field assignment after editing a problem.
   - **Fix:**
     - All quotient digits are now assigned to step 0 in both field generation and UI.
     - On editing, all user answers are cleared (no preservation of old answers).
     - Result: Submit button is enabled when all fields are filled, and submission works as expected.

2. **Keyboard Navigation Order**
   - **Current State:**
     - Added debug logging to print the order of fields generated by `getAllFieldsInOrder` and to trace cursor movement.
     - The navigation order is still not matching the expected left-to-right, top-to-bottom order for division problems.
     - Initial focus is set to the first field in the generated order, but this may not always be the leftmost field in the UI.
   - **Next Steps:**
     - Refactor `getAllFieldsInOrder` to generate fields in the exact order they appear visually in the UI (left-to-right, top-to-bottom, including all empty boxes).
     - Ensure initial focus logic always targets the leftmost empty field.
     - Remove debug logging after confirming correct navigation order.

---

## Current Focus for Future Work
- **Primary:** Fix keyboard navigation order and initial cursor position for division problems.
- **Secondary:** Ensure the navigation logic is robust and matches the visual layout for all division problem sizes and edge cases.

*This log should be updated after each major debugging step or fix attempt to avoid repeating failed approaches and to document what works.*

## Problem Statement
After editing a completed division problem (e.g., changing 56√∑7 to 560√∑7), the submit button remains disabled even when all fields are filled. This issue only affects Division - the other three operations (Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction) work correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis Timeline

### üîç **Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)**
**Theory**: When `enableEditing` was called, it only set `isEditable: true` but left `isSubmitted: true` and `isComplete: true` unchanged.
**Fix Attempted**: Reset `isSubmitted: false` and `isComplete: false` in all four game state hooks' `enableEditing` functions.
**Result**: ‚ùå Only worked for division temporarily, other operations still had issues.

### üîç **Second Hypothesis (PARTIALLY CORRECT)**
**Theory**: The issue was `updateProblem` being called immediately on every keystroke in onChange handlers, clearing userAnswers and making `areAllFieldsFilled()` return false.
**Fix Attempted**: Implemented temporary state pattern across all operations to only call `updateProblem` when editing finishes.
**Result**: ‚ùå Fixed other operations but Division still broken.

### üîç **Third Hypothesis (PARTIALLY CORRECT)**
**Theory**: Division's complex answer preservation logic was leaving stale/invalid answers that didn't match new problem structure.
**Fix Attempted**: Replaced Division's complex preservation with simple "clear all answers" approach like Multiplication & Subtraction.
**Result**: ‚ùå Still didn't fix submit button.

### üîç **Fourth Hypothesis (INCORRECT)**
**Theory**: Bug in quotient field generation in `getAllFieldsInOrder` - creating one field per step instead of multiple positions.
**Fix Attempted**: Modified `getAllFieldsInOrder` to create quotient fields only for step 0 with multiple field positions.
**Result**: ‚ùå Still didn't fix submit button.

### üîç **Fifth Hypothesis (INCORRECT)**
**Theory**: Division's complex shared validation was misaligned compared to simple validation in other operations.
**Fix Attempted**: Replaced Division's shared validation with simple direct validation and added comprehensive debug logging.
**Result**: ‚ùå Still didn't work, but debug logs revealed the exact issue.

### üîç **SIXTH HYPOTHESIS (CURRENT ATTEMPT) - EXACT BUG IDENTIFIED** ‚è≥
**Theory**: **FIELD GENERATION vs UI MISMATCH!**

**Debug logs revealed:**
- **Expected**: `quotient[0] step0`, `quotient[1] step0` (all quotient digits in step 0)
- **Generated by UI**: `quotient[1] step0`, `quotient[0] step1` (digits assigned to different steps)

**Root Cause**: In `DivisionDisplay.tsx` line 621:
```javascript
const stepIndex = Math.min(digitIndex, problem.steps.length - 1);
```
This assigns quotient digits to different steps, but field generation expects ALL quotient digits in step 0.

**Fix Applied**: Changed to `const stepIndex = 0;` so all quotient digits belong to step 0.

**Expected Result**: Submit button should work because field generation and UI will match.

## Current Status
‚úÖ **SUBMIT BUTTON FIXED!** - quotient step alignment correction worked
üîÑ **NEW ISSUE**: Cursor navigation order is wrong after the fix

## Latest Issue: Cursor Navigation Order
**Problem**: After fixing the submit button, cursor navigation order is incorrect.
- **Expected Order**: quotient[1] ‚Üí multiply[1] ‚Üí multiply[0] ‚Üí subtract[0] ‚Üí bringDown[0] ‚Üí quotient[0] ‚Üí multiply[0] ‚Üí subtract[0]
- **Current Order**: quotient[0] ‚Üí quotient[1] ‚Üí multiply[1] ‚Üí multiply[0] ‚Üí ... (all quotient first, then steps)

**Root Cause**: The `getAllFieldsInOrder` function was putting all quotient fields first, but traditional division navigation should interleave quotient digits with their corresponding steps.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `getAllFieldsInOrder` to interleave quotient digits with steps in traditional division order:
- Each step gets its corresponding quotient digit first
- Then the multiply/subtract/bringDown fields for that step
- Maintains right-to-left positioning for quotient digits

**Expected Result**: Cursor should move in proper division order: quotient digit ‚Üí step operations ‚Üí next quotient digit ‚Üí next step operations

### Sub-Issue: Initial Cursor Position
**Problem**: Even with correct field ordering, cursor was automatically placed on quotient[0] (the "1") instead of the first field in navigation order.

**Root Cause**: Initial `currentFocus` state was hardcoded to:
```javascript
{
    stepNumber: 0,
    fieldType: 'quotient',
    fieldPosition: 0,  // Always starts at leftmost quotient digit
}
```

**Fix Applied**: Added a `useEffect` that sets initial focus to the first field in the navigation order when the problem changes:
```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
    if (problem) {
        const allFields = getAllFieldsInOrder();
        if (allFields.length > 0) {
            setCurrentFocus(allFields[0]);  // Start at first field in order
        }
    }
}, [problem, getAllFieldsInOrder]);
```

**Expected Result**: Cursor should start at quotient[1] (the empty box to the left of "1") and follow the proper navigation order.

## Next Steps if Current Fix Fails
1. **Verify field positions** - Check if position numbering is consistent
2. **Check answer submission timing** - Verify when answers are actually saved to userAnswers
3. **Validate problem structure** - Ensure new problem after editing has correct step count/structure
4. **Compare working operations** - Deep dive into exact differences in answer handling

## Key Learnings
- **Debug logging is essential** - Without the detailed logs we couldn't identify the field mismatch
- **UI and validation must be perfectly aligned** - Any discrepancy in field identification breaks validation
- **Each operation has subtle differences** - Can't assume patterns work across all operations

## Current Debug Strategy

### Console Logging Added
```javascript
// In useKeyboardNav.ts areAllFieldsFilled function:
console.log('üîç Division areAllFieldsFilled - Expected fields:', allFields.map(f => 
    `${f.fieldType}[${f.fieldPosition}] step${f.stepNumber}`
));

console.log('üîç Division areAllFieldsFilled - Existing answers:', userAnswers.map(a => 
    `${a.fieldType}[${a.fieldPosition}] step${a.stepNumber} = ${a.value}`
));

console.log(`üîç Division areAllFieldsFilled - Result: ${allFilled} (${allFields.length} fields, ${userAnswers.length} answers)`);
```

### Testing Steps
1. Open Division tab
2. Complete a problem normally
3. Edit the problem (click on dividend/divisor)

---

## Latest Session - Debug Logs Added

### üîç **Comprehensive Debug Logs Added**
**Purpose**: To identify exactly why submit button remains disabled after editing
**Logs Added**:
1. **Division areAllFieldsFilled** (`src/hooks/useKeyboardNav.ts`): Shows expected fields vs user answers, missing fields
2. **Shared Validation** (`src/hooks/useSharedValidation.ts`): Shows field matching logic and which fields fail validation
3. **Submit Button Render** (`src/components/DivisionProblem/DivisionDisplay.tsx`): Shows disabled state on each render

**Usage**: 
1. Edit a completed division problem 
2. Check console for detailed validation flow
3. Look for `üîç [SUBMIT DEBUG]` messages to trace why button is disabled

**Expected Output**: The logs will show exactly which fields are expected vs which answers exist, revealing the mismatch that keeps the submit button disabled.
4. Change values and click outside to finish editing
5. Fill in all answer fields
6. Check console logs to see:
   - What fields are expected
   - What answers exist
   - Which specific fields are missing answers
   - Why submit button remains disabled

## Files Modified

### Core Logic Files
- `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` - Division disableEditing function (simplified answer preservation)
- `src/hooks/useKeyboardNav.ts` - Division areAllFieldsFilled function (replaced shared validation)

### Component Files (Temporary State Pattern)
- `src/components/DivisionProblem/DivisionDisplay.tsx` - ‚úÖ Fully implemented
- `src/components/AdditionProblem/AdditionDisplay.tsx` - ‚úÖ Implemented  
- `src/components/MultiplicationProblem/MultiplicationDisplay.tsx` - ‚úÖ Implemented
- `src/components/SubtractionProblem/SubtractionDisplay.tsx` - ‚úÖ Implemented

### Game State Hooks (EnableEditing Fix)
- `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` - ‚úÖ Division
- `src/hooks/useAdditionGameState.ts` - ‚úÖ Addition
- `src/hooks/useMultiplicationGameState.ts` - ‚úÖ Multiplication  
- `src/hooks/useSubtractionGameState.ts` - ‚úÖ Subtraction

## Next Steps
1. Test the current fix with console logging
2. Analyze the debug output to identify the exact mismatch
3. Compare working operations (Add/Mult/Sub) vs broken Division
4. Implement targeted fix based on logging results

## Working vs Broken Comparison

### ‚úÖ Working Operations (Add/Mult/Sub)
- Use simple validation: check if each expected field has a corresponding answer
- Clear all answers on problem change
- Direct field-by-field matching

### ‚ùå Broken Operation (Division)  
- ~~Used complex shared validation~~ ‚Üí **FIXED: Now uses simple validation**
- ~~Complex answer preservation~~ ‚Üí **FIXED: Now clears all answers**
- ~~Quotient field generation bug~~ ‚Üí **FIXED: Proper field positions**
- **CURRENT**: Still investigating with console logging

## Status: üîç INVESTIGATING
**Next Action**: Test current fix with console logging to identify exact field/answer mismatch.

## [Recent Attempts: Navigation Order and Auto-Advance] (Did NOT work)

**Date:** [latest attempt]

### What was tried:
1. **Interleaved Navigation Order:**
   - Refactored `getAllFieldsInOrder` to interleave quotient and work fields (for each step: quotient, then multiply, subtract, bringDown).
   - Goal: Make navigation follow traditional division order (quotient, work fields, quotient, work fields, ...).
2. **Auto-Advance Refactor:**
   - Updated `handleAutoAdvance` to always call `moveNext` from the navigation hook, ensuring consistent navigation order.
3. **Single Navigation Log:**
   - Removed all old debug logs from navigation code.
   - Added a single log in `moveNext` to print the navigation order and highlight the current/next field.

### Result:
- **No change in navigation order or auto-advance behavior.**
- Cursor still gets stuck on the first field, and navigation order does not match the expected division workflow.
- Excessive logs from other files (e.g., areAllFieldsFilled, UI render) are still cluttering the console, making debugging difficult.

### Notes:
- These approaches (interleaving navigation, refactoring auto-advance, adding a single log) did NOT resolve the issue.
- There may be a deeper mismatch between the navigation logic and the UI field mapping, or issues with how/when auto-advance is triggered.

---

## Next Steps (Do NOT repeat):
- **Do NOT** try to fix navigation order by only interleaving quotient and work fields in `getAllFieldsInOrder`.
- **Do NOT** try to fix auto-advance by only calling `moveNext` in `handleAutoAdvance`.
- **Do NOT** add more logs without first removing all other debug logs from all related files (including areAllFieldsFilled, UI render, etc.).
- Next steps should include:
  - Removing all remaining debug logs from all files except for a single, clear navigation log.
  - Carefully mapping the UI rendering order and navigation order for each field, and ensuring they match exactly.
  - Adding a utility or shared function to generate the field order for both UI and navigation, if needed.

---

## üîß **LATEST FIX: UI/Navigation Field Alignment** ‚úÖ

**Date:** Current session  
**Issue**: Debug logs showed navigation expected one quotient field per step, but UI generated one quotient field per digit with wrong step assignments.

**Root Cause**: 
- **Navigation**: Creates `quotient[0] step0`, `quotient[0] step1`, etc. (one per step)
- **UI**: Was creating `quotient[position] stepIndex` with `stepIndex = Math.min(digitIndex, problem.steps.length - 1)`

**Fix Applied**: Changed UI quotient field generation in `DivisionDisplay.tsx`:
```javascript
// Before: Digit-based generation
{(() => {
    const quotientDigits = problem.quotient.toString().length;
    return Array.from({ length: quotientDigits }).map((_, digitIndex) => {
        const position = quotientDigits - 1 - digitIndex;
        const stepIndex = Math.min(digitIndex, problem.steps.length - 1);
        return createInput(stepIndex, 'quotient', position);
    });
})()}

// After: Step-based generation
{problem.steps.map((_, stepIndex) => (
    createInput(stepIndex, 'quotient', 0)
))}
```

**Result**: UI now generates exactly what navigation expects:
- One quotient field per step
- All with `fieldPosition: 0`
- Step numbers matching navigation order

**Expected Outcome**: Submit button should now work because field generation perfectly aligns with navigation expectations.

---

## üéØ **CRITICAL: WORKING STATE CAPTURED** ‚úÖ

**Date:** Current session  
**Status:** FIRST TIME we have BOTH working submit button AND correct navigation!

### ‚úÖ **What's Currently Working:**
1. **Submit Button**: ‚úÖ Becomes active when all fields are filled after editing
2. **Navigation Order**: ‚úÖ Cursor moves in correct order through fields
3. **Auto-Advance**: ‚úÖ Moves to next field after typing a digit
4. **Field Generation**: ‚úÖ UI and navigation are perfectly aligned
5. **Editing Flow**: ‚úÖ Can edit problem, fill answers, and submit

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Single Issue to Fix:**
- **Validation Colors**: The "5" shows as red when it should be green for 255√∑5=51
- **Submit Still Works**: Button becomes active despite red validation

### üîß **Current Working Implementation:**

**UI Field Generation** (DivisionDisplay.tsx lines 612-622):
```javascript
// Generate one quotient field per step with fieldPosition: 0
{problem.steps.map((step, stepIndex) => (
    <InputField
        key={`quotient-step-${stepIndex}`}
        stepNumber={stepIndex}
        fieldType="quotient"
        fieldPosition={0}
        // ...
    />
))}
```

**Navigation Field Generation** (useKeyboardNav.ts lines 40-50):
```javascript
// Generate one quotient field per step with fieldPosition: 0
problem.steps.forEach((step, stepIndex) => {
    allFields.push({ stepNumber: stepIndex, fieldType: 'quotient', fieldPosition: 0 });
    // ...
});
```

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Perfect Alignment**: UI and navigation generate identical field coordinates
2. **Step-Based Quotient**: One quotient field per step, all with position 0
3. **Validation Independence**: Submit button works regardless of color validation

### üéØ **Next Step Strategy:**
- **DO NOT TOUCH**: Field generation logic (UI or navigation)
- **DO NOT TOUCH**: Submit button logic
- **ONLY FIX**: Color validation in divisionValidator.ts to match current field structure

### üìä **Current Field Structure for 255√∑5:**
- `quotient[0] step0` ‚Üí Should contain "5" 
- `quotient[0] step1` ‚Üí Should contain "1"
- All other work fields follow same step-based pattern

**CRITICAL**: This structure MUST be preserved when fixing validation colors!

---

## üîß **VALIDATION FIX: Align Validator with Working Field Structure** ‚úÖ

**Date:** Current session  
**Issue:** Quotient "5" showing red when should be green for 255√∑5=51

**Root Cause**: Validator expected old field structure (all quotient digits in step 0 with different positions), but our working system uses new structure (one quotient digit per step with position 0).

**Safe Fix Applied**: Updated ONLY the validator to match our working field structure:

### **Before (Broken Validation):**
```javascript
// Expected: quotient[0] step0, quotient[1] step0 (different positions, same step)
case 'quotient':
    return value === getDigitAtPosition(problem.quotient, fieldPosition);
```

### **After (Fixed Validation):**
```javascript
// Matches: quotient[0] step0, quotient[0] step1 (same position, different steps)
case 'quotient':
    const quotientStr = problem.quotient.toString();
    const quotientDigit = parseInt(quotientStr[stepNumber]);
    return value === quotientDigit;
```

### **Functions Updated:**
1. `validateAnswer()` - Now uses stepNumber as digit index (left to right)
2. `getCorrectAnswer()` - Now uses stepNumber as digit index (left to right)  
3. `isProblemComplete()` - Now checks one quotient per step with position 0
4. `getNextRequiredField()` - Now looks for one quotient per step with position 0

### **Expected Result:**
- **Submit Button**: ‚úÖ Should remain working (no field generation changes)
- **Navigation**: ‚úÖ Should remain working (no field generation changes)
- **Validation Colors**: ‚úÖ Should now show correct colors (green for correct answers)

**Key Success**: Fixed validation without touching the working field generation logic!

## üîß **ADDITION DISPLAY: Smart Leading Zero Suppression** ‚úÖ

**Date:** Current session  
**Issue:** Addition problems showing confusing leading zeros (e.g., "0010" instead of "10")

**Problem Example:**
- 1000 + 10 was displaying as:
  ```
    1000
  + 0010  ‚Üê Confusing leading zeros
  ------
  ```

**Solution Applied**: Added smart digit display logic to `AdditionDisplay.tsx`:

### **Smart Display Logic:**
```javascript
const smartDigitDisplay = (digit: number, originalNumber: number, columnPosition: number, totalColumns: number): string => {
    // If digit is 0, check if it's a leading zero
    if (digit === 0) {
        // Calculate the position from the left (most significant digit)
        const positionFromLeft = totalColumns - 1 - columnPosition;
        const numberStr = originalNumber.toString();
        
        // If this position is beyond the length of the original number, it's a leading zero
        if (positionFromLeft >= numberStr.length) {
            return ''; // Don't display leading zeros
        }
    }
    
    return digit.toString();
};
```

### **Before vs After:**
**Before:**
```
  1000
+ 0010  ‚Üê Leading zeros shown
------
```

**After:**
```
  1000
+   10  ‚Üê Leading zeros suppressed
------
```

### **Key Features:**
1. **Suppresses Leading Zeros**: Won't show "0010", shows "10" instead
2. **Preserves Trailing Zeros**: Still shows "1000" correctly (trailing zeros are meaningful)
3. **Maintains Alignment**: Proper right-alignment preserved
4. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Numbers display as they would be written normally

### **Implementation:**
- Updated both addend1 and addend2 display lines
- Uses original number value to determine if a zero is leading or meaningful
- Calculates position from left to identify leading zeros
- Returns empty string for leading zeros, preserving alignment

**Result**: Addition problems now display numbers naturally without confusing leading zeros while maintaining proper mathematical formatting and alignment.

---

## üîß **SUBTRACTION DISPLAY: Smart Leading Zero Suppression** ‚úÖ

**Date:** Current session  
**Issue:** Subtraction problems showing confusing leading zeros (e.g., "0010" instead of "10")

**Solution Applied**: Added the same smart digit display logic to `SubtractionDisplay.tsx`:

### **Smart Display Logic:**
```javascript
const smartDigitDisplay = (digit: number, originalNumber: number, columnPosition: number, totalColumns: number): string => {
    const numberStr = originalNumber.toString();
    
    // Calculate which digit position this column represents (from right to left, 0-indexed)
    const digitPositionFromRight = columnPosition;
    
    // Calculate the minimum number of columns needed for this number
    const requiredColumns = numberStr.length;
    
    // If this column position is beyond what's needed for this number, don't show anything
    if (digitPositionFromRight >= requiredColumns) {
        return ''; // This is a leading zero position
    }
    
    // Otherwise, show the digit (even if it's 0, because it's meaningful)
    return digit.toString();
};
```

### **Implementation:**
- Updated minuend display: `{smartDigitDisplay(step.digit1, problem.minuend, step.columnPosition, displaySteps.length)}`
- Updated subtrahend display: `{smartDigitDisplay(step.digit2, problem.subtrahend, step.columnPosition, displaySteps.length)}`

### **Example Results:**
**Before:**
```
  1000
- 0010  ‚Üê Leading zeros shown
------
```

**After:**
```
  1000
-   10  ‚Üê Leading zeros suppressed
------
```

### **Key Features:**
1. **Suppresses Leading Zeros**: Won't show "0010", shows "10" instead
2. **Preserves Trailing Zeros**: Still shows "1000" correctly (trailing zeros are meaningful)
3. **Maintains Alignment**: Proper right-alignment preserved
4. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Numbers display as they would be written normally

**Result**: Subtraction problems now display numbers naturally without confusing leading zeros, matching the improved Addition display behavior.
