# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Touch-Friendly Error Correction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a touch-friendly error correction workflow for mobile users.
# Details:
Design and implement a touch-based error correction interface. Use touch events to allow users to correct errors without needing a keyboard. Ensure compatibility with existing keyboard navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Test touch interactions on various mobile devices to ensure smooth error correction.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Touch-Based Error Correction Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a design for an interface that allows users to correct errors using touch gestures.
### Details:
Focus on user-friendly design principles and ensure the interface is intuitive for touch interactions.

## 2. Implement Touch Event Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop the functionality to handle touch events within the error correction interface.
### Details:
Implement touch gestures such as tap, swipe, and pinch to interact with the error correction features.

## 3. Ensure Compatibility with Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2
### Description: Modify the interface to support keyboard navigation alongside touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that all features accessible via touch are also accessible via keyboard shortcuts or navigation.

### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2, 29.3
### Description: Analyze the complexity of the designed and implemented interface.
### Details:
Evaluate the complexity of the interface in terms of usability, performance, and maintainability.

## 5. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of error correction before any changes.
### Details:
Review current error correction patterns in each operation's Display component.

## 6. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.5
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles error correction best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 7. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4, 29.6
### Description: Ensure error correction fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated error correction is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 8. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.7
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 9. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.8
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
