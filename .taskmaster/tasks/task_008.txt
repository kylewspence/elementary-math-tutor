# Task ID: 8
# Title: Simplify App.tsx for Tab Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor App.tsx to focus on tab management and shared hook orchestration.
# Details:
Move operation-specific logic out of App.tsx and into their respective components. Ensure App.tsx handles tab switching and shared hook orchestration efficiently.

# Test Strategy:
Test tab switching and shared hook functionality to ensure no regressions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extract Logic from App.tsx [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and extract business logic from App.tsx into separate modules to improve maintainability.
### Details:
Review the App.tsx file to identify sections of code that handle business logic. Create new modules or services to encapsulate this logic, ensuring that the extracted code is well-documented and tested.

## 2. Refactor for Tab Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Refactor the application to implement a more efficient tab management system.
### Details:
Utilize the extracted logic to refactor the tab management system. Ensure that the new system aligns with the architectural blueprint and supports dynamic tab creation and destruction.

## 3. Test Tab Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive test suite to verify the functionality of the new tab management system.
### Details:
Create unit and integration tests to cover all aspects of tab functionality, including edge cases. Ensure that the tests are automated and can be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## 4. Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Analyze and optimize the performance of the refactored application, focusing on the tab management system.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the tab management system. Implement optimizations to reduce load times and improve responsiveness, ensuring that changes do not introduce new bugs.
