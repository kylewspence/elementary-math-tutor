# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Subtraction into App
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Add subtraction to the main application, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with existing operations.
# Details:
Add subtraction to GameMode type and include subtraction game state and handlers. Ensure automatic problem generation and focus management useEffects are implemented for subtraction, following the patterns used for other operations. Add subtraction to initialization, auto-save, and auto-restore useEffects to ensure full integration with the session persistence system. Follow the exact patterns from App.tsx for addition without making any changes to existing operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test mode switching, problem generation, focus management, and persistence to ensure subtraction integrates seamlessly with other operations. Ensure that addition, division, and multiplication remain unchanged.
