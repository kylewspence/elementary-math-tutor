# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Carry Number Functionality for Multiplication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 19, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Focus on implementing the carry number functionality specifically for the multiplication tab, ensuring it is intuitive and visually consistent with the rest of the application.
# Details:
To implement the carry number functionality for multiplication, add empty boxes above the multiplication problem where carrying is necessary. These boxes should initially contain '?' placeholders to indicate that they are for carry numbers. The layout should match the existing approach used in the division tab. Integrate these carry boxes into the existing keyboard navigation flow, ensuring that users can navigate to them using Tab and Shift+Tab keys. Update the navigation logic to recognize these new input fields as part of the natural problem-solving sequence. Ensure that the carry boxes are visually distinct yet consistent with the overall design and are correctly positioned above the relevant digits in the multiplication problem.

# Test Strategy:
1. Open the multiplication tab and verify that empty boxes with '?' placeholders appear above the problem where carrying is needed.
2. Use the Tab key to navigate through the input fields and ensure that the focus moves to the carry boxes in the correct sequence.
3. Enter values in the carry boxes and verify that they can be edited and saved correctly.
4. Use Shift+Tab to navigate backwards and ensure the focus moves in reverse order through the input fields, including the carry boxes.
5. Check the visual alignment and styling of the carry boxes to ensure they are visually distinct yet consistent with the rest of the UI.
