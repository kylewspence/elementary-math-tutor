# Task 26: Implement Carry Number Functionality for Multiplication

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Dependencies:** 18, 19, 25

## Description
Add carry number functionality to the multiplication tab with '?' placeholders and integrate it with keyboard navigation.

## Details
To implement the carry number functionality for multiplication, first, ensure that empty boxes are added above the multiplication problem where carrying is necessary. These boxes should initially contain '?' placeholders to indicate that they are for carry numbers. The layout should match the existing approach used in the division tab. Integrate these carry boxes into the existing keyboard navigation flow, ensuring that users can navigate to them using Tab and Shift+Tab keys. This requires updating the navigation logic to recognize these new input fields as part of the natural problem-solving sequence. Ensure that the carry boxes are visually consistent with the rest of the UI and that they are correctly positioned above the relevant digits in the multiplication problem.

## Test Strategy
1. Open the multiplication tab and verify that empty boxes with '?' placeholders appear above the problem where carrying is needed.
2. Use the Tab key to navigate through the input fields and ensure that the focus moves to the carry boxes in the correct sequence.
3. Enter values in the carry boxes and verify that they can be edited and saved correctly.
4. Use Shift+Tab to navigate backwards and ensure the focus moves in reverse order through the input fields, including the carry boxes.
5. Check the visual alignment and styling of the carry boxes to ensure consistency with the rest of the UI.
