# Task ID: 2
# Title: Extract Shared Subcomponents
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract ProblemInput and ValidationFeedback components to a shared directory.
# Details:
Move ProblemInput and ValidationFeedback from the Division components to a new shared directory. Ensure these components are properly typed with TypeScript and can be reused across different operations.

# Test Strategy:
Ensure that the extracted components work correctly in the Division operation without any errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extract and Modularize Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and extract components from the existing codebase to improve modularity and reusability.
### Details:
Review the existing codebase to identify components that can be modularized. Extract these components into separate modules, ensuring that dependencies are properly managed and that the components are reusable across different parts of the application.

## 2. Implement TypeScript Typing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add TypeScript typing to the extracted components to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
### Details:
Once components are extracted, implement TypeScript typing for each component. Ensure that all interfaces and types are defined according to the architectural blueprint and that the code compiles without errors.

## 3. Test Integration of Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Conduct integration testing to ensure that the newly modularized and typed components work together seamlessly.
### Details:
Develop and execute integration tests to verify that the components interact correctly within the application. Focus on edge cases and ensure that the integration aligns with the shared architecture goals.
