# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Subtraction Display Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the display component for subtraction problems by copying the structure of the AdditionDisplay component exactly, including imports, prop interfaces, and function patterns. Ensure no architectural drift by following the mandatory copy checklist.
# Details:
Create src/components/SubtractionProblem/SubtractionDisplay.tsx by copying AdditionDisplay.tsx file structure exactly. Replace addition-specific math logic (addend1 + addend2 = sum) with subtraction logic (minuend - subtrahend = difference). Follow the mandatory copy checklist: use the same mobile sticky controls pattern from AdditionDisplay lines 450-528, including 'fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-t border-gray-200 p-4 z-50' styling, submit button logic (disabled until filled, 'Submit Answers' â†’ 'Next Problem'), and wrong answer handling with orange feedback box. Use a simple layout with minuend, minus sign, subtrahend, horizontal line, and difference input fields. Utilize the same GRID_CONSTANTS and styling patterns as AdditionDisplay. Ensure all mobile patterns, including pb-32 padding for sticky controls, are copied. Use existing UI/Input component. Maintain the same prop interfaces and function structure as AdditionDisplay.

# Test Strategy:
Visually compare the subtraction display to the addition display to ensure structural and behavioral consistency. Verify that subtraction logic is correctly implemented and that all shared patterns, including mobile sticky controls and feedback handling, are preserved. Ensure no architectural drift by adhering strictly to the mandatory copy checklist.
