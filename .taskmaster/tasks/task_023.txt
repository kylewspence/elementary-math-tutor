# Task ID: 23
# Title: Fix Remaining TypeScript and Lint Errors
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix all TypeScript and lint errors in the multiplication components and address critical UI issues.
# Details:
Address all TypeScript and lint errors identified in the codebase, particularly in the multiplication-related files. Ensure all components use proper typing and follow the project's code style guidelines. Additionally, standardize the MultiplicationDisplay component layout to be visually indistinguishable from the division page, except for the mathematical operation. This includes removing unnecessary text like 'multiplication tutor' and 'level 1' headings, eliminating any 'next step' box, ensuring the container/wrapper around the equation is identical, standardizing the position and styling of the problem header, positioning input boxes consistently, and ensuring the completion message appears in the same position and styling.

# Test Strategy:
Test the MultiplicationDisplay component to ensure it matches the division page layout exactly. Verify that all TypeScript and lint errors are resolved. Conduct user testing to confirm that the layout is standardized, unnecessary elements are removed, and the visual appearance is consistent with the division tab.

## 111. Consider rewriting MultiplicationDisplay component [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: If the existing MultiplicationDisplay component proves too difficult to modify, create a new component that mirrors the DivisionDisplay structure. Ensure the new component uses the same styling, layout, and component structure, adapting only the logic specific to multiplication operations. Maintain all features such as editable problems and keyboard navigation. Ensure the button layout and styling exactly matches the division tab, and remove any unnecessary elements that don't exist in the division tab.
