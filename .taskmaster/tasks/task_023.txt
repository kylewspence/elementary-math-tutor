# Task 23: Fix Remaining TypeScript and Lint Errors

**Status:** in-progress
**Priority:** high
**Dependencies:** 16

## Description
Fix all TypeScript and lint errors in the multiplication components and address critical UI issues.

## Details
Address all TypeScript and lint errors identified in the codebase, particularly in the multiplication-related files. Ensure all components use proper typing and follow the project's code style guidelines. Additionally, rewrite the MultiplicationDisplay component to match the division page's simple and clean layout. Resolve the following critical issues: reduce the number of boxes to avoid confusion, ensure the cursor starts at the correct position, add '?' placeholders in empty boxes, fix typing issues, and ensure the navigation order is logical and intuitive.

## Test Strategy
Test the MultiplicationDisplay component to ensure it matches the division page layout. Verify that all TypeScript and lint errors are resolved. Conduct user testing to confirm that the cursor starts correctly, '?' placeholders are visible, typing functions properly, and navigation is intuitive.
