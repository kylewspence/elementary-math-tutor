# Task ID: 24
# Title: Unify Layout and Structure of Multiplication and Division Tabs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 17, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the layout and structure of the multiplication and division tabs are identical, removing unnecessary elements.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the current layout of both the multiplication and division tabs. Identify all elements that differ between the two, including buttons, containers, and any structural components. Remove any unnecessary text such as 'multiplication tutor' and 'level 1' headings from both tabs. Eliminate the 'next step' box from the layout. Ensure that all visual elements, such as button styles, container borders, and spacing, match exactly between the two tabs. Use CSS to standardize styles and ensure that any JavaScript logic affecting layout is consistent. Coordinate with the team responsible for Task 20 to ensure button layouts are standardized. After implementing changes, conduct a visual comparison to verify exact matches.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct a visual inspection of both tabs to ensure they are identical in layout and structure. Use a design comparison tool to overlay screenshots of both tabs and identify any discrepancies. Verify that all unnecessary text and elements have been removed. Ensure that the removal of elements does not affect functionality by testing all interactive components. Confirm that the changes do not introduce any new visual or functional bugs.
