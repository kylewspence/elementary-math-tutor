# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enhance useMathGameState Hook
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure useMathGameState handles all operation types consistently.
# Details:
Review and enhance useMathGameState to ensure it supports all operations uniformly. Add any necessary configurations for future operations like Subtraction.

# Test Strategy:
Verify state management consistency across all operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review Current Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the existing codebase to understand the current logic implementation.
### Details:
Examine the current state management logic and document how it interacts with existing operations. Identify any potential areas for improvement or refactoring to align with architectural goals.

## 2. Add Support for New Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement new operations in the codebase while ensuring compatibility with existing logic.
### Details:
Based on the review, integrate new operations into the state management system. Ensure these operations are consistent with the architectural blueprint and do not disrupt existing functionality.

## 3. Test State Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Conduct tests to verify the consistency of state management across all operations.
### Details:
Develop and execute test cases that cover both existing and new operations. Ensure that state transitions are handled correctly and that the system maintains consistency as per the complexity analysis.
