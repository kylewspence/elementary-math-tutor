# Task ID: 20
# Title: Standardize Button Layout and Icons
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Match button placement and styling with other tabs and add relevant icons.
# Details:
Implement the same button set (Submit/Check, Next, Reset, New Problem) with consistent styling (colors, sizes, hover effects). Specifically, update the multiplication tab to match the division tab's button layout, which is arranged in a triangle formation with Submit Answers at the top, and Reset Problem and New Problem side by side below it. Ensure all buttons have identical styling (colors, hover effects, font weights) and positioning. Add relevant icons to buttons for visual appeal.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the button layout in the multiplication tab matches the division tab's triangle formation. Check that all buttons have consistent styling, including colors, hover effects, and font weights. Ensure icons are present and correctly aligned on each button. Test across different browsers and screen sizes to confirm responsiveness and visual consistency.
