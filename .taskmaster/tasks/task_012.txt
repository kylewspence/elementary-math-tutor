# Task ID: 12
# Title: Extend API Integration for Subtraction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance API integration to include subtraction-specific logic.
# Details:
Update src/utils/apiService.ts to include subtraction in level requirement checking and API call tracking. Implement error handling and fallback to local generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration to ensure subtraction problems are fetched and handled correctly, with proper error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update API Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing API logic to enhance integration capabilities.
### Details:
Review the current API implementation and identify areas for improvement. Implement changes to optimize data flow and ensure compatibility with new requirements.

## 2. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling to the API logic to manage potential failures.
### Details:
Design and implement error handling mechanisms to capture and respond to various error scenarios. Ensure that the system can gracefully handle unexpected inputs and failures.

## 3. Test Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop and execute tests for fallback mechanisms to ensure system resilience.
### Details:
Create test cases to simulate failure scenarios and verify that fallback mechanisms operate correctly. Adjust the logic as necessary to ensure robust performance under adverse conditions.
