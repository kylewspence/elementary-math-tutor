# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Multiplication Tab Keyboard Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure keyboard navigation works identically in the multiplication tab.
# Details:
Implement tab/shift+tab and arrow key navigation in the multiplication tab, ensuring it matches the behavior of other tabs.

# Test Strategy:
Test keyboard navigation in the multiplication tab to ensure it is consistent with other tabs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Navigation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the navigation logic to ensure consistent behavior across different tabs.
### Details:
Use the architectural blueprint to guide the implementation. Reference existing navigation code to maintain consistency and functionality. Ensure that the navigation logic is modular and can be easily integrated with other components.

## 2. Test Keyboard Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create and execute tests for keyboard interactions to ensure they work as expected.
### Details:
Develop test cases based on the architectural blueprint to verify that keyboard interactions are functioning correctly. Ensure tests cover all possible user interactions and edge cases. Reference existing test frameworks and methodologies.

## 3. Ensure Consistency Across Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Review and adjust components to ensure consistency in behavior and appearance.
### Details:
Conduct a thorough review of all components to ensure they align with the architectural blueprint. Make necessary adjustments to maintain a consistent user experience across the application. Reference existing style guides and component libraries.
