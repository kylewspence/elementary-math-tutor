# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Subtraction Calculation Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement borrowing logic for subtraction calculations.
# Details:
Create src/utils/subtractionCalculator.ts to handle borrowing logic in subtraction. Implement calculateSubtractionSteps function to process borrowing and calculate differences.

# Test Strategy:
Test borrowing logic with edge cases to ensure correct calculation of differences and borrowing steps.

# Subtasks:
