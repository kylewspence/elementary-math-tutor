# Task 16: Fix TypeScript Errors in Project

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Dependencies:** 1, 6

## Description
Resolve all TypeScript errors identified during the build process to ensure successful project compilation.

## Details
This task involves addressing 26 TypeScript errors that have been identified in the project. These errors include type mismatches between different problem types such as DivisionProblem, AdditionProblem, and MultiplicationProblem. Additionally, there are unused variables and imports that need to be removed, missing required properties in returned objects that must be added, and issues with state management in the useGameState hook that need to be resolved. Start by reviewing the TypeScript error log to identify the specific files and lines where errors occur. For type mismatches, ensure that all problem types have consistent interfaces and type definitions. Remove any unused variables and imports to clean up the code. For missing properties, review the function or component signatures to ensure all required properties are included. Finally, investigate the useGameState hook to resolve any state management issues, ensuring it correctly manages and updates state as expected.

## Test Strategy
To verify the completion of this task, run the TypeScript compiler to ensure there are no remaining errors. Conduct a build process to confirm the project compiles successfully without any TypeScript errors. Additionally, perform manual testing of the application to ensure all functionalities work as expected, particularly focusing on areas where errors were fixed. Use a linter to check for any remaining unused variables or imports.
