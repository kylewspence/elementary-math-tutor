Research and compare different automation tools based on compatibility, ease of use, and integration capabilities with the existing system.

## 4. Automate Regression Test Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2, 40.3
### Description: Develop scripts to automate the execution of the regression test cases using the selected tools.
### Details:
Use the selected automation tools to write scripts that automate the execution of the designed test cases, ensuring they are maintainable and scalable.

## 5. Integrate Automated Tests into CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.4
### Description: Incorporate the automated regression tests into the continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
### Details:
Ensure that the automated tests are triggered automatically with each build and deployment, providing immediate feedback on the stability of the system.

## 6. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of regression testing before any changes.
### Details:
Review current regression testing patterns in each operation's Display component.

## 7. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.6
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles regression testing best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 8. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.5, 40.7
### Description: Ensure regression testing fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated regression testing is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 9. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.8
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
