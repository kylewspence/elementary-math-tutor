# Task ID: 41
# Title: Performance Testing with Complex Number Formats
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Evaluate application performance with complex number formats.
# Details:
Conduct performance testing using complex number formats to ensure the application remains responsive. Optimize rendering and validation logic as needed.

# Test Strategy:
Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize code.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Complex Number Formats for Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and list various complex number formats that need to be included in the performance testing.
### Details:
Gather information on different complex number formats that are commonly used in the application or industry. This may include formats like polar, rectangular, and exponential forms.

## 2. Conduct Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Perform performance testing using the identified complex number formats to evaluate the current system's efficiency.
### Details:
Use the list of complex number formats to run performance tests. Record the time taken and resource usage for each format to identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

## 3. Optimize Code Based on Test Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.2
### Description: Analyze the performance test results and optimize the code to improve efficiency with complex number formats.
### Details:
Review the performance data to identify areas of the code that require optimization. Implement changes to improve processing speed and resource usage, and verify improvements with additional testing.

## 4. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of performance testing before any changes.
### Details:
Review current performance testing patterns in each operation's Display component.

## 5. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.4
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles performance testing best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 6. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.3, 41.5
### Description: Ensure performance testing fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated performance testing is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 7. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.6
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 8. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.7
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
