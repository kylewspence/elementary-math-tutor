# Task ID: 34
# Title: Fix Number Rendering with Trailing Zeros
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Correct rendering of numbers with trailing zeros to prevent display corruption.
# Details:
Debug and update the number rendering pipeline to handle trailing zeros correctly. Ensure numbers like 1000 and 2000 display without character substitution.

# Test Strategy:
Test number rendering across all operations and difficulty levels to ensure accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Issues in Number Rendering Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current number rendering pipeline to identify issues related to incorrect display of numbers with trailing zeros.
### Details:
Review the existing codebase and documentation to understand how numbers are currently being processed and rendered. Look for any discrepancies or bugs that might cause trailing zeros to be displayed incorrectly.

## 2. Update Rendering Logic for Correct Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Modify the rendering logic to ensure numbers are displayed correctly with trailing zeros.
### Details:
Based on the issues identified, update the rendering logic to handle numbers with trailing zeros appropriately. Ensure that the changes are consistent with the desired output format.

## 3. Test and Validate Number Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2
### Description: Conduct tests to validate that the updated rendering logic displays numbers correctly, including those with trailing zeros.
### Details:
Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the rendering logic works as expected. Validate the output against the requirements and document any remaining issues.

## 4. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of number rendering before any changes.
### Details:
Review current number rendering pipeline in each operation's Display component.

## 5. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.4
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles number rendering best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 6. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.3, 34.5
### Description: Ensure number rendering fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated number rendering is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 7. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.6
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 8. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.7
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
