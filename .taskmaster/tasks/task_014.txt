# Task ID: 14
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application to maintain performance standards.
# Details:
Ensure the application maintains sub-second response times for all interactions. Optimize rendering and state updates where necessary.

# Test Strategy:
Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and verify optimization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profile Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Measure the current performance of the system to establish a baseline.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to gather data on system performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and execution time.

## 2. Identify Bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Analyze profiling data to identify performance bottlenecks.
### Details:
Examine the profiling data to find areas where the system is underperforming or consuming excessive resources.

## 3. Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement changes to address identified bottlenecks and improve system performance.
### Details:
Apply optimization techniques such as code refactoring, algorithm improvements, or resource management adjustments.

## 4. Verify Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Test the system to ensure that performance optimizations have been successful.
### Details:
Re-profile the system and compare the results to the baseline to confirm that performance has improved.
