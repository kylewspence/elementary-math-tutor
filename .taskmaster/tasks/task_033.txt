# Task ID: 33
# Title: Enhance User Feedback for Division Carry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Provide clear feedback for division carry operations to improve educational accuracy.
# Details:
Design feedback mechanisms that guide users through division carry operations. Use tooltips or inline hints to explain different carry methods.

# Test Strategy:
Evaluate user feedback effectiveness through user testing sessions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research User Feedback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate various user feedback mechanisms suitable for division carry operations.
### Details:
Explore existing tools and methods for providing feedback in mathematical operations, focusing on division carry operations. Document findings and best practices.

## 2. Design Feedback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Create designs for feedback mechanisms based on research findings.
### Details:
Using the research findings, design user feedback mechanisms such as tooltips or inline hints that can be integrated into the division carry operations interface.

## 3. Implement Tooltips and Inline Hints [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Develop and integrate tooltips or inline hints into the division carry operations interface.
### Details:
Based on the designs, implement the feedback mechanisms in the user interface, ensuring they provide clear and helpful guidance during division carry operations.

## 4. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of user feedback before any changes.
### Details:
Review current user feedback patterns in each operation's Display component.

## 5. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.4
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles user feedback best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 6. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.3, 33.5
### Description: Ensure user feedback fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated user feedback is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 7. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.6
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 8. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.7
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
