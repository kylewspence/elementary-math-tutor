# Task ID: 30
# Title: Prevent Auto-Acceptance of Correct Answers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor logic to require explicit submit action for all answer confirmations.
# Details:
Update validation logic to prevent automatic acceptance of correct answers. Require users to explicitly tap the submit button to confirm answers. Ensure changes are applied consistently across all operations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that correct answers are not auto-accepted and require user confirmation on all operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze current validation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing validation logic to identify areas that require changes to incorporate an explicit submit action.
### Details:
Examine the current codebase to understand how validation is currently implemented and identify the specific parts of the code that need to be updated.

## 2. Implement explicit submit action in validation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Modify the validation logic to include an explicit submit action, ensuring that all necessary checks are performed before submission.
### Details:
Update the code to require an explicit submit action, ensuring that all validation checks are triggered only upon this action.

## 3. Ensure consistency across operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Review and update all operations to ensure consistent application of the new validation logic with the explicit submit action.
### Details:
Go through all operations in the system to ensure they adhere to the updated validation logic and make necessary adjustments for consistency.

## 4. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of validation logic before any changes.
### Details:
Review current validation logic in each operation's validator.

## 5. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles validation logic best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 6. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3, 30.5
### Description: Ensure validation logic fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated validation logic is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 7. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.6
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 8. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.7
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
