# Task ID: 25
# Title: Enhance Keyboard Navigation for Multiplication Tab
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 18, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement intuitive keyboard navigation for multiplication problems, ensuring the flow mimics natural problem-solving methods.
# Details:
Focus on creating a keyboard navigation system where the cursor starts in the first empty box under the equation under the single digit. The navigation should then jump up to a 'carry' box if needed, otherwise move to the second empty box under the equation. This should reflect the natural right-to-left flow a user follows when solving multiplication problems, including handling carries appropriately. Ensure Shift+Tab navigates in reverse order. Analyze the logical sequence a user follows when solving multiplication problems and implement it programmatically. Ensure consistency with existing navigation logic across tabs.

# Test Strategy:
1. Open the multiplication tab and press Tab to ensure the focus starts at the first empty input box under the equation under the single digit.
2. Enter a value and press Tab again to verify the focus moves to the 'carry' box if applicable, or the next empty input box.
3. Use Shift+Tab to navigate backwards and ensure the focus moves in reverse order correctly.
4. Ensure the navigation order is consistent with how multiplication is taught (right-to-left, handling carries appropriately).
5. Test with various multiplication problem sizes to ensure the navigation logic handles all cases correctly.
