# Task 25: Enhance Keyboard Navigation for Multiplication Tab

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Dependencies:** 7, 18, 24

## Description
Ensure keyboard navigation in the multiplication tab is intuitive and matches the division tab, focusing on natural problem-solving flow.

## Details
Implement keyboard navigation such that when a user presses Tab, the focus moves to the first empty input box under the equation. If a 'carry' box is needed, the focus should shift there next. Otherwise, the focus should move to the next empty box under the equation. This should mimic the natural flow a user would follow when solving multiplication problems manually. Ensure Shift+Tab navigates in reverse order. This task requires understanding the logical sequence a user follows when solving multiplication problems and implementing it programmatically. Coordinate with the existing navigation logic to ensure consistency across tabs.

## Test Strategy
1. Open the multiplication tab and press Tab to ensure the focus starts at the first empty input box under the equation.
2. Enter a value and press Tab again to verify the focus moves to the 'carry' box if applicable, or the next empty input box.
3. Use Shift+Tab to navigate backwards and ensure the focus moves in reverse order correctly.
4. Compare the navigation flow with the division tab to ensure consistency.
5. Test with various multiplication problems to ensure the navigation logic handles all cases correctly.
