# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Editable Problem Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the multiplication problem's edit functionality matches the division tab's behavior.
# Details:
Focus on refining the existing implementation in the MultiplicationDisplay component to ensure it matches the division tab. Verify that the problem is clickable to enter edit mode, shows input fields for multiplicand and multiplier, implements click-outside behavior to save changes, and includes the same edit mode indicator text as the division tab. Ensure the styling and positioning of the editable problem header matches the division tab exactly.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct a side-by-side comparison of the multiplication and division tabs to ensure consistent behavior and appearance. Test the click-to-edit functionality, input field display, click-outside save behavior, and edit mode indicator text. Verify that the styling and positioning are identical to the division tab.
