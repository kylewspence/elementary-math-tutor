# Task ID: 1
# Title: Audit Shared Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a thorough audit of the current architecture to ensure all components and patterns are consistent and ready for subtraction integration. Document existing patterns and components that subtraction should copy exactly, without any changes.
# Details:
Review all existing patterns and components. Document the exact shared patterns such as GRID_CONSTANTS, mobile controls pattern, and UI components. Analyze and document the exact submit logic pattern used in AdditionDisplay.tsx (lines 450-528) as the template. Document the exact mobile sticky controls pattern: 'fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-t border-gray-200 p-4 z-50' and 'pb-32'. Document the exact UI component usage: Input from UI/, Button patterns, GRID_CONSTANTS. Document the exact App.tsx integration patterns: useEffect for auto-generation, focus, persistence. Document the exact Header.tsx tab button pattern. Create a copy-paste checklist for subtraction implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all existing patterns and components are documented accurately and exactly as they are. Ensure that the documentation clearly outlines how subtraction should copy these patterns without any changes. Confirm that all operations function correctly with their current embedded submit patterns.
