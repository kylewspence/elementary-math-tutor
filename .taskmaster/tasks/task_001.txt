# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the required structure and dependencies, and prepare for integration with the multiplication components.
# Details:
Create a new branch for the integration project. Ensure the repository includes React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Set up the initial folder structure as outlined in the PRD. Prepare the repository to integrate the multiplication components by creating a MultiplicationDisplay component, useMultiplicationGameState hook, and useMultiplicationKeyboardNav hook. Adapt the multiplication-specific components to match our division tutor's style and behavior, and integrate with the existing App component. Implement a consistent UI and state management system across multiplication and division components. The basic file structure for the multiplication component has been created, including types, API service updates, a validator, and a problem generator.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds successfully, the initial structure is in place, and the multiplication components are correctly integrated and styled to match the division tutor. Test keyboard navigation and ensure consistent behavior across all game modes. Ensure the new route for the multiplication component is functional and the navigation is updated accordingly.
