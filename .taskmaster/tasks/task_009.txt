# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Subtraction Tab to Header
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Include a subtraction tab in the header component, matching the style and behavior of existing operation tabs. Centralize the GameMode type to ensure consistency across the application.
# Details:
Modify the Header component to include a subtraction tab. Ensure the styling and behavior are consistent with other operation tabs by copying the existing tab button structure exactly. Extract the GameMode type to a centralized location to eliminate duplication and add 'subtraction' to the type.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the subtraction tab appears and functions identically to other operation tabs, particularly the addition tab. Ensure that the GameMode type is correctly imported and used in both App.tsx and Header.tsx, and that 'subtraction' is included in the type.
