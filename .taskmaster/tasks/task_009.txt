# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for the refactored codebase to maintain functionality and prevent regressions.
# Details:
Develop unit and integration tests for all components and hooks. Use a testing framework compatible with the existing tech stack.

# Test Strategy:
Achieve 100% test coverage and ensure all tests pass consistently.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create unit tests for individual components or functions to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
### Details:
Identify key components and functions within the codebase that require unit testing. Write tests using a suitable testing framework and ensure they cover various edge cases.

## 2. Develop Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create integration tests to verify that different components or systems work together as intended.
### Details:
Identify interactions between components that need testing. Develop tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios to ensure components interact correctly.

## 3. Achieve Coverage Goals [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Ensure that the test suite achieves the desired level of code coverage.
### Details:
Analyze current test coverage reports and identify areas lacking sufficient tests. Write additional tests to cover these areas and meet the coverage targets.

## 4. Ensure Test Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Verify that tests consistently produce the same results and are reliable.
### Details:
Run tests multiple times to ensure they are deterministic and not flaky. Address any issues causing inconsistent test results.
