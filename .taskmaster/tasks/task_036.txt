# Task ID: 36
# Title: Redesign Submit Button State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor submit button state management for consistent behavior.
# Details:
Update state management logic to ensure submit button behaves consistently across all operations and error states. Use modern state management libraries if necessary.

# Test Strategy:
Test submit button behavior in various states to ensure consistency and reliability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current State Management Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing state management logic for the submit button to understand its current implementation and identify areas for improvement.
### Details:
Examine the codebase to document how the submit button's state is currently managed, including any conditions or dependencies that affect its behavior.

## 2. Refactor State Management Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Refactor the state management logic for the submit button to improve efficiency and maintainability.
### Details:
Implement changes to the state management logic based on the analysis, ensuring that the new logic is more efficient and easier to maintain.

## 3. Develop Test Cases for Submit Button [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.2
### Description: Create comprehensive test cases to verify the behavior of the submit button across different states.
### Details:
Design test cases that cover all possible states and transitions of the submit button to ensure the refactored logic works as expected.

## 4. Execute Tests and Validate Behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Run the developed test cases to validate the behavior of the submit button and ensure all states are handled correctly.
### Details:
Execute the test cases and document the results, making sure that the submit button behaves correctly in all scenarios.

## 5. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of submit button state management before any changes.
### Details:
Review existing submit button state management in each operation.

## 6. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.5
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles submit button state management best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 7. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.4, 36.6
### Description: Ensure submit button state management fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated state management is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 8. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.7
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 9. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.8
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
