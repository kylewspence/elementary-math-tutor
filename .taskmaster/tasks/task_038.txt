# Task ID: 38
# Title: Test Mobile Compatibility for Error Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure error recovery workflows are fully compatible with mobile devices.
# Details:
Conduct comprehensive testing of error recovery workflows on mobile devices. Ensure all interactions are intuitive and accessible without a keyboard.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing on iOS and Android devices to validate error recovery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: List all potential error scenarios that can occur in the mobile application.
### Details:
Review the application documentation and codebase to identify areas where errors might occur. Consider user input errors, network issues, and unexpected application states.

## 2. Develop Test Cases for Error Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Create detailed test cases for each identified error scenario to test the application's error recovery workflows.
### Details:
For each error scenario identified, develop a test case that includes the steps to reproduce the error, the expected behavior of the application, and the criteria for successful error recovery.

## 3. Execute Error Recovery Tests on Mobile Devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.2
### Description: Perform the error recovery tests on various mobile devices to ensure compatibility and robustness.
### Details:
Use a range of mobile devices with different operating systems and versions to execute the test cases. Document any issues encountered and verify that the application recovers from errors as expected.

## 4. Pattern Analysis Subtask [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document exact current behavior of error recovery before any changes.
### Details:
Review current error recovery patterns in each operation's Display component.

## 5. Reference Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.4
### Description: Identify which existing operation handles error recovery best.
### Details:
Analyze the current implementations to determine the most effective pattern.

## 6. Consistency Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.3, 38.5
### Description: Ensure error recovery fix applies uniformly across all 4 operations.
### Details:
Verify that the updated error recovery is consistent across Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction.

## 7. Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.6
### Description: Test all operations after changes to ensure no regressions.
### Details:
Perform regression testing on Division, Addition, Multiplication, and Subtraction to ensure existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 8. Mobile Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.7
### Description: Maintain sticky controls, responsive design, and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure that mobile experience remains exactly as before, with no new UI elements introduced.
