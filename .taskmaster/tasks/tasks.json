Should be: User changes answer → `isCorrect = null` → Submit again to validate\n\nFix Required:\n- Update subtraction `clearAnswer` to match addition pattern (no auto-validation when `isSubmitted = true`)\n- Update division `submitAnswer` to match addition pattern (mark as `null` when `isSubmitted = true`)\n- Update division `clearAnswer` to match addition pattern (no auto-validation when `isSubmitted = true`)\n\nImplementation Strategy:\nFollow exact same pattern as addition/multiplication:\n- When `isSubmitted = true` and user changes answers → mark `isCorrect = null` (pending)\n- Only validate on explicit `submitProblem()` call\n- Reset `isComplete = false` when answers change after submission\n</info added on 2025-06-22T01:54:31.154Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-22T02:12:58.505Z>\nCRITICAL INCONSISTENCY FOUND: Division and Subtraction Display Logic\n\nProblem: After my hook fixes, Division and Subtraction still show red when users change incorrect answers, while Addition and Multiplication correctly show grey (pending state).\n\nRoot Cause: I updated the game state hooks but didn't update the display component logic for Division and Subtraction to handle `isCorrect === null` properly.\n\nCurrent Behavior:\n- Addition/Multiplication: Wrong answer → User changes → Grey (pending) → Submit → Validation\n- Division/Subtraction: Wrong answer → User changes → Still red → Submit → Validation\n\nFix Required:\n- Update DivisionDisplay.tsx `getInputVariant` function to handle `isCorrect === null`\n- Update SubtractionDisplay.tsx `getInputVariant` function to handle `isCorrect === null`\n- Ensure consistent color logic: null = grey, true = green, false = red\n</info added on 2025-06-22T02:12:58.505Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-22T02:14:11.367Z>\n**✅ DISPLAY CONSISTENCY FIX COMPLETED**\n\n**Problem:** Division and Subtraction stayed red when users changed incorrect answers, while Addition and Multiplication correctly turned grey (pending state).\n\n**Root Cause:** Division and Subtraction `getInputVariant` functions had incorrect logic:\n```tsx\n// OLD (BROKEN): Always returned 'error' for any non-true value\nif (isSubmitted && userAnswer) {\n    return userAnswer.isCorrect === true ? 'correct' : 'error';\n}\n// This meant isCorrect === null (pending) showed as 'error' instead of 'default'\n```\n\n**Solution:** Updated both display components to handle `isCorrect === null` properly:\n```tsx\n// NEW (FIXED): Explicit null handling\nif (isSubmitted && userAnswer) {\n    if (userAnswer.isCorrect === true) return 'correct';   // Green\n    if (userAnswer.isCorrect === false) return 'error';   // Red  \n    // If isCorrect === null (pending), fall through to default (Grey)\n}\n```\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- `src/components/DivisionProblem/DivisionDisplay.tsx` - Fixed getInputVariant logic\n- `src/components/SubtractionProblem/SubtractionDisplay.tsx` - Fixed getInputVariant logic\n\n**Verification:**\n- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors\n- All 4 operations now have consistent behavior:\n  - Submit wrong answer → Red\n  - Change answer → Grey (pending)\n  - Submit again → Green/Red based on correctness\n\n**Final State:** All 4 math operations (Division, Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction) now have identical color behavior for the submit → change → resubmit flow.\n</info added on 2025-06-22T02:14:11.367Z>",

This bypasses the submit workflow and doesn't teach proper problem-solving completion habits.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nUsers should need to explicitly hit \"Submit\" for all answers, even correct ones. Correct answers should show as \"neutral/pending\" (grayed out) until submitted, then turn green only after submission.\n\nInvestigation Needed:\n1. Find where auto-acceptance logic occurs in the Input component or validation hooks\n2. Identify if this happens in `onAnswerSubmit` handlers or input change handlers\n3. Determine if this affects all 4 operations or just some\n4. Check if the visual feedback (green highlighting) happens immediately or after submission\n\nKey Areas to Examine:\n- Input component's onChange vs onBlur behavior\n- Game state hooks' answer submission logic\n- Display components' input styling based on validation state\n- Validation functions that might trigger immediate acceptance\n</info added on 2025-06-21T20:37:27.659Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-21T20:38:15.045Z>\nPATTERN ANALYSIS COMPLETE - AUTO-ACCEPTANCE IDENTIFIED\n\nRoot Cause Found:\nThe auto-acceptance happens in the game state hooks' `submitAnswer` function. When `isSubmitted` is true and user enters a new answer, it immediately re-validates:\n\n```typescript\nif (prev.isSubmitted && prev.problem) {\n    const validatedAnswers = updatedAnswers.map(ans => {\n        const isCorrect = validateAdditionAnswer(prev.problem!, ans);\n        return { ...ans, isCorrect };\n    });\n}\n```\n\nCurrent Flow:\n1. User submits problem → `isSubmitted = true`\n2. User changes an answer → `submitAnswer` called\n3. Since `isSubmitted = true`, answer is immediately validated\n4. If correct, `isCorrect = true` is set\n5. Display component sees `isCorrect = true` and shows green color\n\nExpected Flow:\n1. User submits problem → `isSubmitted = true`  \n2. User changes an answer → `submitAnswer` called\n3. Answer should be marked as \"pending\" (not validated until resubmission)\n4. Display component shows gray/neutral color for pending answers\n5. Only when user hits Submit again should validation occur\n\nAffected Operations:\nThis pattern exists in ALL 4 game state hooks:\n- `useAdditionGameState.ts`\n- `useMultiplicationGameState.ts` \n- `useSubtractionGameState.ts`\n- `useDivisionGameState.ts`\n\nFix Strategy:\nModify the `submitAnswer` functions to NOT auto-validate when `isSubmitted = true`. Instead, mark new answers as \"pending\" until explicit resubmission.\n</info added on 2025-06-21T20:38:15.045Z>",

Generate a test problem with 1000 (dividend or divisor).\n2. Examine how digits are extracted and rendered in DivisionDisplay.\n3. Check if similar issues exist in other operation displays.\n4. Identify the root cause of the \"- - -\" rendering instead of \"0 0 0\".\n\nGoal: Document exactly how numbers with trailing zeros currently render before fixing.\n</info added on 2025-06-22T01:58:20.152Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-22T02:00:44.214Z>\n**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Quotient Box Count Mismatch**\n\n**Problem:** For 1000 ÷ 5 = 200, the quotient should display as \"2 0 0\" but shows as \"2 - 0\"\n\n**Root Cause:** \nCurrent code creates quotient boxes based on number of division steps:\n```tsx\n{problem.steps.map((_, stepIndex) => {\n    return createInput(stepIndex, 'quotient', 0)\n})}\n```\n\n**Issue:**\n- For 1000 ÷ 5, there are 2-3 division steps but quotient \"200\" needs 3 digits\n- Current: Creates 2-3 boxes with position=0 for each (wrong!)\n- Expected: Create 3 boxes with positions 0,1,2 for digits 0,0,2\n\n**Fix Required:**\n- Change quotient rendering to create boxes based on quotient digit count\n- Use proper position indexing (0=rightmost, 1=middle, 2=leftmost) \n- Each box should call `createInput(stepIndex, 'quotient', position)` with correct position\n\n**Current:** `stepIndex` maps to division steps\n**Needed:** `position` maps to digit positions in the quotient\n</info added on 2025-06-22T02:00:44.214Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-22T02:02:06.748Z>\n**✅ QUOTIENT DISPLAY FIX IMPLEMENTED**\n\n**Changes Made:**\n\n**1. DivisionDisplay.tsx - Fixed Quotient Box Generation:**\n```tsx\n// OLD: Created boxes per division step (wrong count)\n{problem.steps.map((_, stepIndex) => {\n    return createInput(stepIndex, 'quotient', 0)\n})}\n\n// NEW: Create boxes per quotient digit (correct count)\n{(() => {\n    const quotientDigits = problem.quotient.toString().length;\n    return Array.from({ length: quotientDigits }).map((_, digitIndex) => {\n        const position = quotientDigits - 1 - digitIndex; // Right to left positioning\n        const stepIndex = Math.min(digitIndex, problem.steps.length - 1);\n        return createInput(stepIndex, 'quotient', position);\n    });\n})()}\n```\n\n**2. divisionValidator.ts - Fixed Quotient Validation:**\n```tsx\n// OLD: Validated against step.quotientDigit (single digit)\ncase 'quotient': return value === step.quotientDigit;\n\n// NEW: Validate against quotient digit at position\ncase 'quotient': return value === getDigitAtPosition(problem.quotient, fieldPosition);\n```\n\n**3. Updated Completion Logic:**\n- Check all quotient digit positions in step 0 only\n- Each position validates against correct digit in quotient\n\n**Result:** \n- 1000 ÷ 5 = 200 now shows \"2 0 0\" instead of \"2 - 0\"\n- All quotient digits properly validated\n- TypeScript compilation successful\n</info added on 2025-06-22T02:02:06.748Z>",

Modify the borrow validation logic to accept both traditional and alternative methods. The traditional method checks the exact borrowReceived value, while the alternative method allows for reduced digit approaches. 3. Refactor the validation logic to be flexible and accommodate both methods seamlessly. 4. Ensure that the changes are backward compatible and do not disrupt existing functionality. 5. Collaborate with the team responsible for state management hooks to ensure that the updated logic integrates smoothly with the existing state management system.",

Develop test cases for both traditional and alternative borrow validation methods to ensure they are accepted correctly. 3. Conduct regression testing to ensure that the changes do not affect other parts of the application, particularly focusing on subtraction and validation logic. 4. Perform manual testing to validate the user experience and ensure that the borrow validation is intuitive and accurate. 5. Use automated testing tools to run the entire test suite and confirm that all tests pass successfully.",
