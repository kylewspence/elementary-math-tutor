# Task ID: 27
# Title: Update Mobile Error Messaging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace 'press enter' messaging with mobile-appropriate instructions across all math operations.
# Details:
Identify all instances of 'press enter' in the codebase. Replace with 'tap submit' or similar mobile-friendly instructions. Ensure changes are consistent across all four math operations (Division, Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction).

# Test Strategy:
Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome to ensure messages are clear and consistent.

# Subtasks:
