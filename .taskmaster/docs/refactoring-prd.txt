# Math Tutor Codebase Refactoring PRD

## Project Overview
The Math Tutor application is a step-by-step math practice tool that currently supports division, addition, and multiplication operations. The application has been carefully designed with attention to detail in user experience, including specific tab navigation patterns, cursor positioning, and visual feedback. The goal of this refactoring project is to improve code maintainability and reduce duplication without changing the user experience or functionality.

## Current State
- The application has three main tabs: Division, Addition, and Multiplication
- Each tab has its own display components, logic hooks, and validation
- There is significant code duplication across these features
- The application has carefully tuned UX details that must be preserved
- The current functionality works correctly after numerous bug fixes

## Refactoring Goals
1. Reduce code duplication across math operation components
2. Create reusable components for common UI elements
3. Standardize state management patterns
4. Improve type definitions and interfaces
5. Enhance code organization and file structure
6. Maintain 100% functional parity with the current implementation
7. Preserve all UX details including tab navigation and cursor behavior

## Non-Goals
1. Adding new features or math operations
2. Changing the visual design or user experience
3. Modifying the core math logic or validation rules
4. Performance optimizations (unless they come naturally with refactoring)

## Technical Requirements
1. Identify common patterns across math operation components
2. Extract shared logic into reusable hooks
3. Create abstracted components that can be configured for different math operations
4. Standardize prop interfaces across similar components
5. Implement comprehensive test coverage to ensure refactored code maintains exact functionality
6. Document architecture decisions and component relationships
7. Ensure the refactored code is easy to extend for future math operations

## Success Criteria
1. No change in user experience or visual appearance
2. All existing functionality works exactly as before
3. Significant reduction in code duplication (measured by lines of code)
4. Improved code organization and readability
5. Simplified component hierarchy
6. Consistent patterns across the codebase
7. Comprehensive documentation of the refactored architecture

## Constraints
1. Must maintain exact functional parity with current implementation
2. Must preserve all UX details including tab navigation and cursor behavior
3. Refactoring should be done incrementally to allow for thorough testing
4. The project must use the existing tech stack (React, TypeScript, etc.)

## Technical Approach
1. Begin with an audit of the current codebase to identify duplication and patterns
2. Create a detailed refactoring plan with specific components to extract
3. Implement shared utilities and hooks first
4. Refactor one math operation at a time, starting with the simplest
5. Implement comprehensive tests before and after each refactoring step
6. Document architecture decisions and component relationships

## Deliverables
1. Refactored codebase with reduced duplication
2. Architecture documentation
3. Component relationship diagrams
4. Test coverage report
5. Before/after code metrics showing reduction in duplication
