# Long Division Tutor - Integration Project PRD

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Long Division Tutor is an interactive educational web application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a step-by-step guided experience for learning long division through a clean, keyboard-optimized interface with progressive difficulty levels. The application currently features a robust division component with 10 difficulty levels, advanced keyboard navigation, and real-time validation.

This PRD outlines the plan to integrate a separately developed multiplication component into the existing Long Division Tutor, creating a comprehensive Math Tutor application that maintains consistency in user experience, code quality, and educational approach.

## 🌟 Integration Goals

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Integrate the multiplication component while maintaining the look, feel, and UX patterns of the existing division tutor.
2. **Code Consistency**: Ensure the integrated multiplication code follows the same architectural patterns, naming conventions, and code quality standards as the division component.
3. **Unified Navigation**: Maintain the advanced keyboard navigation system (Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter key workflow) across both components.
4. **Visual Cohesion**: Create a unified visual design that treats both components as part of a single application.
5. **Minimal Disruption**: Preserve all existing division functionality without regression.

## 📊 Current Application Structure

The current Long Division Tutor features:

- **10-Level Progressive Difficulty**: From simple single-digit division to complex multi-digit problems
- **Traditional Visual Layout**: Familiar long division format matching classroom teaching
- **Advanced Keyboard Navigation**: Complete Tab/Shift+Tab navigation with Enter key workflow
- **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate feedback with color-coded visual indicators
- **Problem Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for custom problems

## 🔄 Integration Requirements

- Implement the same button set: Submit/Check, Next, Reset, New Problem
- Add relevant icons to buttons for visual appeal

### 5. Editable Problem
- Make the multiplication problem editable when clicked
- Show edit mode with input fields for multiplicand and multiplier
- Implement click-outside behavior to save changes
