## üë®‚Äçüéì User Journey

### 1. Level Selection

Students begin by selecting from 10 progressive difficulty levels:
- **Levels 1-3** (Beginner): Single-digit divisors with 2-3 digit dividends
- **Levels 4-6** (Intermediate): Two-digit divisors with 3-4 digit dividends
- **Levels 7-8** (Advanced): Three-digit divisors with 4-5 digit dividends
- **Levels 9-10** (Expert): Four-digit divisors with 5-6 digit dividends

### 2. Problem Solving

The student is presented with a division problem in the traditional format:
1. **Input quotient digit** (Tab to navigate, Enter to submit)
2. **Input multiply result** (right to left, digit by digit)
3. **Input subtraction result** (right to left, digit by digit)
4. **Input bring-down digit** (if applicable)
5. **Repeat** for each step of the division process

### 3. Feedback & Progression

After completing all inputs:
1. **Submit with Enter key** (submit button pulses when ready)
2. **Receive immediate feedback** (correct answers in green, incorrect in red)
3. **Press Enter again** to advance to the next problem
4. **Track progress** through the level selector
