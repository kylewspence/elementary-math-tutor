## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. **Select Level**: Choose from 10 progressive difficulty levels
### 2. **Solve Problems**: Use keyboard/numpad for input with instant auto-advance
### 3. **Navigate Seamlessly**: Tab forward, Shift+Tab backward, type to replace
### 4. **Submit with Enter**: Press Enter to submit when all fields complete
### 5. **Continue with Enter**: Press Enter again to navigate to next problem
### 6. **Edit Problems**: Click on problem statement to create custom problems

### Keyboard Controls
- **Tab**: Move to next field (quotient → multiply → subtract → bring down → next step)
- **Shift+Tab**: Move to previous field (continuously backward)
- **Numbers**: Instant input with auto-advance
- **Enter**: Submit answers when complete, navigate to next when submitted
- **Backspace/Delete**: Clear current field
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate within multi-digit fields

### Visual Feedback
- **Pulsing Submit Button**: Indicates when all fields are complete and ready to submit
- **"Submit Answers (Enter)" Text**: Clear indication of Enter key functionality
- **Auto-Select**: All text selected on field focus for easy replacement

## 🔧 Development
